## Introduction

Data visualization is a powerful way to represent data in graphical or visual formats, making it easier to comprehend patterns, trends, and relationships within the data. This project aims to provide practical examples and tutorials for creating effective visualizations using popular Python libraries.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/data-visualization-python.git
   cd data-visualization-python
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```
