## Introduction

Data visualization is a powerful way to represent data in graphical or visual formats, making it easier to comprehend patterns, trends, and relationships within the data. This project aims to provide practical examples and tutorials for creating effective visualizations using popular Python libraries.

The Visualisation project is a collection of Python scripts for various visualization techniques, including README.md, bfs.py, bubblesort.py, conway.py, cool-shapes.py, dfs.py, flag.py, fourierFlag.py, insertionsort.py, mergesort.py, nQueen.py, pixel.py, primeSpiral.py, quicksort.py, selectionsort.py, and snake.py. Each file represents a different visualization algorithm or technique, allowing users to explore and understand these concepts through interactive and visual representations. These scripts can be used as educational tools or as a starting point for developing more complex visualizations.

The README.md file provides an overview of the project and instructions on running each script. The bfs.py file implements the Breadth-First Search algorithm, while the bubblesort.py file demonstrates the Bubble Sort algorithm. The conway.py file implements Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton simulation.

To run the bfs.py script, users need to input a graph as an adjacency list and specify the starting vertex. Bubblesort.py allows users to provide a list of numbers to be sorted, and conway.py allows users to define an initial configuration of cells on a grid and observe how they evolve over time according to the game's rules.

However, the initial configuration of cells on the grid may not lead to a stable pattern and instead evolves over time, allowing users to observe how they evolve according to the game's rules. In both cases, the scripts provide a comprehensive collection of Python scripts for exploring and understanding various visualization techniques.


## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/data-visualization-python.git
   cd data-visualization-python
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Navigate to the specific example directory:
   ```
   cd examples/bar_chart
   ```

   ```
   or
   ```
   python bar_chart_example.py
   ```

3. Follow the code and comments to understand the process of creating the visualization.
